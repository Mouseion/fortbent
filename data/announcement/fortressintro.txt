[P]you have died. now dont look so sad! its not much
to worry about. you have all eternity to relive your memories!
how about we play a game? i have one! you are an expedition leader to
a civilization of trolls known as [VAR:NATIVENAME:GLOBAL:YOURCIV]!
(wait you dont speak that language? ok! you could also call them [VAR:TRANSLATEDNAME:GLOBAL:YOURCIV]!)
oh and you were playing sburb right before you died right?
good! you can remember it right? just barely? oh well!
try to remember. this is all dream bubbles so other peoples memories may intrude.
thats ok. dont mind them. itll probably even be fun!
 with what you and others can remember we can set up this game!
heres how it goes: youve set off to colonize an area. there are...
lets see. oh! do you remember [VAR:NAME_PLURAL:GLOBAL:LOCAL_LARGE_PREDATOR]?
yeah there are lots of those! Whole lot!
[P]ive digressed.
There are almost no supplies left but
if you can kill enough things youll have enough grist
to last you forever!
your memories and others will spin a tale at [VAR:NATIVENAME:GLOBAL:YOURFORT], "[VAR:TRANSLATEDNAME:GLOBAL:YOURFORT]".
hope youre ok with being dead!
